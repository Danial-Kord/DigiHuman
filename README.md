# DigiHuman
Digihuman is a project which aims to automatically generate <b>whole body pose animation + facial animation</b> on 3D Character models based on the camera input.
<br/>
This project is my B.Sc thesis of Computer Engineering at Amikabir University Of Technology(AUT).



## About DigiHuman
DigiHuman is a system for bringing automation in animation generation on 3D virtual characters.
It uses Pose estimation and facial landmarks generator models to create entire body and face animation on 3D characters.
<br/>
This project is done with **MediaPipe** and **Unity3D**.
MediaPipe generates 3D landmarks for the human whole body and face, and Unity3D is used to render the final animation after processing the generated landmarks from MediaPipe.
